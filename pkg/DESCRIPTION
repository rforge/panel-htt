Description: The Package implements a new class of panel data models. This class allow for unobserved heterogeneity in time trends. These can be interpreted in the classical way as realizations from a real random variable or as realizations from a functional random variable. The package comes with diverse recently developed tests on dimensionality as well as with a routine for (functional) principal component analysis.
